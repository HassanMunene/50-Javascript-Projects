This is the first project of the many that will come

This small project basically uses three technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript

The project has 3 files:

index.html : This will contain the bare structure of the document by defining the different components that the project will have

style.css: This will style the html document to make it more appealing

style.js: This will give the page dynamic behavior especially when certain elements of the page are clicked they will produce a response
