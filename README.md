# 50-Javascript-Projects

This is the beginning of my journey in learning Javascript I have been doing javascript for quite sometime now and now I think is the time to really start applying the knowledge that I have learnt so far. So I have decided to start doing projects everyday that entail html, css and javascipt until day number 50.

The project could even be more than fifty but the minimum will be 50. So help me God
